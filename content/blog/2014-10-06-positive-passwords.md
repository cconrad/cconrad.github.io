I believe in a couple of principles:

* Long passwords can be both strong and memorizable.
* Positive affirmations do work to improve habits and self esteem.
* Writing or typing something is a better way to remember it than just reading it.
  
Here's how I might combine these beliefs:

1. Start with an affirmation that makes sense for you, here is a generic cliche:  
_Today is going to be the best day of my life._

2. Change some words to make the sentence illogical:  
_Today was gonna be the super day of my lifes._

3. Introduce some more spelling and grammar mistakes:  
_Todei wass gonna bee teh supahst dai ov my lifez._

4. Add digits and special characters:  
_T0dei/wass\gonna B33_teh-supahst-dai,ov;my?lifez!1_

There is a pass phrase that should be pretty secure against brute force and rainbow attacks and makes one think of the initially selected affirmation whenever it is entered.
