Shame on me, but I am sitting in a train bound back home, after returning 3 of our special needs kids back to their father - they have been with us for 2 weeks - 'nough said?

Okay, probably not - though it was a hard time trying to get work done while avoiding the constant lingering tantrums from untreated children :(

So, in a kindof new format, here's what I accomplished anyway:

Work

*   Changed almost all page templates to load JavaScript using the AMD standard (a progressiv style of coding that allows developers to modularize code instead of copy/pasting, while retaining functionality and performance due to the ability to bundle modules together in .js files) (MM)
*   Inlined some ads to avoid the last synchronous iframe loading on the frontpage (MM)
*   Noticed Google Page Speed go down about 30% (i.e. faster loading of pages) due to switching from synchronously loaded ads to ads loaded in "friendly iframes" (with both of our ad servers, Emediate and Google DFP Small Business) (MM)

Relationships

*   Had some good talks with Mikkel
*   Supported Birgit in branding herself personally

Life

*   Paid some overdue invoices
*   Sent an invoice to MM that hopefully will be paid in time so that I don't get overdue again on payments next month

**Plans for next week:**

Work

*   Fix JavaScript and CSS bugs tue do the previous refactoring (MM)
*   Recreate functionality that existed before the switch to the new design (MM)

Relationships

*   Reestablish a better relationship with my girlfriend after the last weeks' stress

Life

*   Improve my personal finances by declaring company expenses as such
*   Improve my personal finances by settling debts with my girlfriend

**Please feel free to hold me accountable to the above goals in 1 week from now - i'd appreciate it :)**
