I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your vacation!

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list (see my story [Swedish language](../swedish-language/)) or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

If you have some good links, please add a comment!
