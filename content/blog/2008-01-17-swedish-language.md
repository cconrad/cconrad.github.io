Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

**Language**  
The Swedish language is not as hard as it might look at first glance! For me it bears a lot of resemblance to Danish and to a lesser extent also to German. The best part though is that you'll hardly find another country where you can expect almost anybody to understand and speak fluent English than Sweden.
