excerpt: I’ll be moving to Sweden in about a month, so I collected some links about public transport there. I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your vacation!

title: Public transport in Sweden

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list (see my story "Links: Swedish language") or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

Getting around using public transportation is easy and fast in Sweden, although it might be a tad expensive, depending on where you come from.
