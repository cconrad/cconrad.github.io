title: Skype as a SIP gateway
---
A new business product, Skype Connect is a regular SIP gateway, albeit one that is connected to the Skype network. For 4.95 a line/month professional users and enterprises can receive calls from Skype users on regular phones (connected to a SIP VoIP router or software/hardware SIP PBX), receive calls from Skype landline numbers ("Skype-In numbers") and route their outgoing calls at cheap Skype rates.
