The reason I chose this machine instead of the main competitor (in my country of residence, Sweden) Lenovo MiiX 2 was the battery lifetime and my previous experience with Asus; I own one of their Ultrabooks, which has never let me down and still now, approx. 3-4 years after purchasing it, feels like the fastest and most stable computer I ever owned.

So when I purchased my Transformer I was flabbergasted to find that one of the included applications, called "Asus Screen Saver", required a password, otherwise I was unable to uninstall it!

Thanks to some googling and [a friendly user on transformerforums.com](http://www.transformerforums.com/forum/asus-transformer-book-t100-general-discussions/45023-asus-screen-saver-password.html#post332536), I finally found the password, which is **8777**.
