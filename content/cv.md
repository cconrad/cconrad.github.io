# CV (Resume)

## Cover letter

I am a software developer/technical project manager with broad expertise, having successfully implemented end-to-end solutions using numerous technologies. Most recently my primary focus has been on SPA development using open-source frameworks, though I believe in a "choosing the right tool for the right job" philosophy.

Keeping myself constantly updated about the rapidly changing world of web and app development is something I take a lot of pride in, to the extent of sometimes literally dreaming about new technologies after falling asleep to the latest industry podcasts. While I generally consider open-source software as important building blocks for custom projects due to their extensability, I strive to never take a religious stance on business choices and consequently enjoy working with whatever technology fits the job and environment at hand in the best way.

In a world of constantly changing browser and OS market shares I consider web standards to be very important. Whenever feasible I use a development strategy of progressive enhancement, enabling older browsers to fall back to a less feature-rich but still usable site/app. AJAX, HTML5 and "responsive design" are all samples of technologies I made use of years before they became industry-wide buzz words. This also applies to "DevOps", which I have always seen as a logical extension of the work areas of a professional developer, where deployment and scalability need to be more than an afterthought.
