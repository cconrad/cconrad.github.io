### Resume

I am a software developer with broad expertise, having successfully implemented end-to-end solutions using numerous technologies. Recently my primary focus has been on frontend and client-side web development using open-source frameworks, though I believe in a "choosing the right tool for the right job" philosophy.

Keeping myself constantly updated about the rapidly changing world of web and app development is something I take a lot of pride in, to the extent of sometimes literally dreaming about new technologies after falling asleep to the latest industry podcasts. While I generally consider open-source software as important building blocks for custom projects due to their extensability, I strive to never take a religious stance on business choices and consequently enjoy working with whatever technology fits the job and environment at hand in the best way.

In a world of constantly changing browser and OS market shares I consider web standards and cross-browser support to be very important. Whenever feasible I use a development strategy of progressive enhancement, enabling older browsers to fall back to a less feature-rich but still usable site/web app. AJAX, HTML5 and "responsive design" are all samples of technologies I made use of years before they became industry-wide buzz words. This also applies to "devops", which I have always seen as a logical extension of the work areas of a professional web developer, where deployment and scalability need to be more than bugs to be fixed.

Some of the technologies I have worked with include: jQuery, Dojo, Sencha Touch, AJAX, JSON and generic Javascript; Microsoft .NET, Windows Forms, C#, ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC; HTML 4.01, XHTML and HTML5; Magento, Drupal 7, Symfony 2 and generic PHP; Pyramid and Python/IronPython; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 through 2008, IBM DB2, MySQL 4 and 5, Sqlite 3 and PostgreSQL 9, as well as all versions of CSS.
