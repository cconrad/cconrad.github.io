teaser: 'I recently listened to an <a href="https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2010-01-20-show/">interview with Clint Arthur</a> about his "Last year of your life" program, which I found interesting. The program''s five basic steps are:'

1.  Decide this is the last year of your life.
2.  Write down what you want to achieve.
3.  Share your goals with a community of people.
4.  Create a system where you hold yourself accountable.
5.  Congratulate yourself when you achieve your goal.

My own unedited notes from the show:

*   Goal of the program: to get everything you possibly can out of each day.
*   The most important part is to make the decision (that this is the last year of your life).
*   Stop drinking caffeine.
*   You don't have time to indulge in self-pity.
*   Wake up with the feeling "Today is the last (January 24th or whatever day it is) of my life".
*   Realize that with your limited time, there will be things you are no longer willing to tolerate.
*   Don't become a slave to your watch, but before doing anything, ask yourself if it's important enough to be part of your last year on earth.
*   78% of all new years resolutions are abandoned before the end of January.
*   Break tasks into smaller steps to make them achievable.
*   Reward yourself for successes.
*   Focus on the benefits of the goals, that you can reap once you achieved them.
*   Share goals with at least 5 others who are supportive.
*   Write goals for the whole year down, simply thinking or saying them is not powerful enough.
*   Schedule regular review times, e. g. each week, where you go through your goals and cross the achieved ones of.
*   Affirmations are powerful tools to affect the subconscious.
*   Celebrate achieved goals.
*   Break any habits of criticizing yourself.
*   Even though you're breaking bigger goals into doable parts, always focus on how having the larger goal finally achieved will feel.
*   "If you are afraid (of something), you must (do it)" (Tony Robbins)
*   Know what you want, what's really important to you.
*   First week: Start with loving and acknowledging yourself.
*   Second week: Acknowledge goals you achieved previously in your life.
*   With the right mindset lots of things can be achieved in one year, but there is basically nothing you can't achieve in 5 years with the same mindset.
*   Don't unfriend everybody who isn't supportive of your goals, because different-minded people are part of the richness of life, but maximize time spent with people who think as big or bigger than you. Be aware of the fact that listening to others negative beliefs WILL influence your subconscious, and tell yourself that you don't want anyone else to run your life.
*   Doing something 99% is easy, the last percent is the hard part. If you only convince your subconscious to do something to 99%, e. g. working out each day, it becomes easy to convince yourself to skip a day and soon you will have stopped the activity altogether.
*   The huge amount of belief that Clint Arthur seems to have in his own ability to achieve his goals is part of why his motivational speech works
*   Using affirmations many times a day is an integral part of why this program works.
*   The more goals you have, the more results are you going to achieve. Whether you have few or many goals for the year, some will fall away. If you look closely at those you didn't achieve, you might realize that they weren't important to you in the first place.
*   Tips for successful mantras (affirmations): Make them time-based and specific. Include clear-cut goals and the timeline to achieve them in. Example: "It is now Dec. 31st, 2010 and I'm earning XXX/year. I am proud of my income, I inspire those around me, and I'm grateful to be a man who can earn XXX/year."
*   Quitting smoking is one of the most important things one can do.
*   He recommends Tony Robbins "Unleash the power within" program.
*   If you have a hard time asking others for help, realize that many people love to help others
*   **Finding your passion:** Do what you really love. What makes you excited? What did you enjoy as a child, when you were 6-7 years old? Cut back on unneccesary expenses, focus instead on what really excites you. Look for inspiration from your inner child.
*   Your goals need to be realistic. Tripling your income is possible with the right attitude, going from zero to a million in 1 year is not. You have to be able to belief your goals if you want to be able to program your subconscious.
*   You will make as much money as the value you provide to other people. The more real value you provide, the more you earn. Sitting on the couch watching TV is not providing value to anybody.
*   The way a warrior lives: Today is a great day to die, because I lived all days before just the way I wanted to.
