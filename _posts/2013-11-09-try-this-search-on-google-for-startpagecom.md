I tried DuckDuckGo once and it had this nice "Try this search on..." menu to repeat your search on other, more common or specialized, search engines. Unfortunately Startpage / ixQuick doesn't have a similar function, so I made a small user script to achieve the same functionality (assuming you run Chrome
or Chromium - other browsers are not currently supported).

How to install:

1. Right-click and save [startpagecom-google.user.js](https://github.com/cconrad/userscripts/raw/master/startpagecom-google.user.js)
2. Open Extension settings
3. Drag-and-drop the script from the download bar at the bottom of Chrome/Chromium into the Extension settings
4. Allow access to your data on startpage.com

How to use:

1. To repeat a search on Google, click the "Enhanced by Google" logo to the right of the search box on any results page on startpage.com.
