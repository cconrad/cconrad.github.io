teaser: I’ll be moving to Sweden in about a month, so I collected some links which I’d like to share here. I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your holiday!

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list (see my story "Links: Swedish language") or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

Unfortunately I haven't really been on holiday in Sweden for more than a weekend, so if you have some good links, please add a comment!

*   [Visit Stockholm](https://www.visitstockholm.com/)  
    For tourists, in English and Swedish.

*   [Yasuragi](https://yasuragi.se/)  
    This is a Zen-buddhistic inspired wellness place near Stockholm. I haven't visited it, but been recommended it by friends. Page in English and Swedish.
