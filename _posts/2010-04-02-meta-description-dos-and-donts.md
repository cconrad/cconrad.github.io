### Do:

*   Include your keywords.
*   Write compelling, informative and concise.
*   Describe your content honestly.
*   If there are different sections in the description, identify and separate them clearly.

### Don't:

*   Reuse the same "boilerplate" description on several pages.
*   Duplicate information from the page title.
*   Use more than 160 characters.
*   Simply reuse AdWords ads.
*   Write a meta description in every case. For example, a page listing dozens of blog entries targeting many different keywords might be better of with the SE-generated snippet of text surrounding the users search phrase.
