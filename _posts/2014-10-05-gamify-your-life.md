While listening to a podcast about Angular (a front-end JavaScript framework I am using) I came across this "game": [HabitRPG](https://www.habitrpg.com/). HabitRPG is not so much a RPG but very much a todo list and habit tracker, with some gamification elements appealing to old-school RPG connoisseurs (or nerds) like myself. It combines some (and unfortunately only some) of the features of to-do lists such as [Remember The Milk](https://www.rmilk.com/) with some elements of RPGs. That sounds somewhat crazy, but I wouldn't dismiss it that easily, so I am trying it out right now for self-improvement and -development purposes.

If you don't know what the abbreviation RPG means, I'd suggest to stay away from HabitRPG, because it very much looks like a tool by nerds for nerds, but if you do, and are interested in improving your real-life habits, giving it a try can't harm you. I would suggest every new "player"/user to read "[Establishing your tasks](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Establishing_Your_Tasks)".
