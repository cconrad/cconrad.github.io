teaser: "A little late, but I would still like to grab the opportunity and extend my congratulations to the OpenSolaris team for releasing the 4th major edition of OpenSolaris this month. It feels like the first edition came out just yesterday, but looking at the impressive <a href=\"http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/features/whats-new/200906/\">list of new and advanced features</a> they have already come a long way, compared to other OSes during the same short timespan. Check it out at <a href=\"http://www.opensolaris.com/\">OpenSolaris.com</a>."
