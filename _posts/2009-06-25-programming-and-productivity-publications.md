teaser: Scott Hanselman recently wrote up a list of "<a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/six-essential-language-agnostic-programming-books">Six Essential Language Agnostic Programming Books</a>". That list, including the comments with other suggestions, is certainly worth a look. I have to admit that I haven't read most of what he lists, and only skimmed others.

Instead of trying to add to his list, here I think a little broader than just programming: which books and other media have had an impact on my professional or general productivity?

*   [Getting Real - the smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real) by 37signals (they ought to know).  
    One of these books with short, precise, right-to-the-point chapters - fortunately most of them are real gems. Its message boils down to "the easiest way to achieve something is often the right one".
*   [Inbox Zero](https://www.43folders.com/izero)  
    I was one of those persons using the inbox as my mailbox, calendar and to-do list. Inbox Zero retaught me the joy of e-mail - by using it less. Highly recommended.

The following books are still unread on my shelf, so I can't really recommend them yet - but from what I heard, they are quite popular (and I really need to get those for my reader!):

*   [Dreaming in Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400082471?ie=UTF8&tag=clausconrad-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400082471)
*   [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&tag=clausconrad-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142000280)
