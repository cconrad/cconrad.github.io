This is a nice tool that runs perfectly well on Windows 8 with minimal resource usage. It works with any window I tried yet, doesn't require administrative rights as far as I know, has no cumbersome installation/setup process, and the code is open source (C++).

Give it a try if you use Windows :)

[Download RBTray](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rbtray/)
