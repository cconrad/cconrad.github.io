teaser: I’ll be moving to Sweden in about a month, so I collected some links which I’d like to share here. I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your holiday!

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list (see my story "Links: Swedish language") or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

Sweden is one of the more expensive countries in Europe I guess, but it is also on the forefront of new technologies and services. For example, supermarkets are starting to offer home delivery and internet shopping! Chains and smaller immigrant-driven shops offer rich asortments of food from all over the globe at affordable prices.

Some larger supermarket chains:  

*   [ICA](https://www.ica.se/)
*   [Netto](https://www.netto.se/)
*   [Willy's](https://www.willys.se/)

Some specialized sites:

*   [bokfynd.nu](https://www.bokfynd.nu/)  
    This site compares book prices from different vendors. Save some money on those books for your study. Page in Swedish.
