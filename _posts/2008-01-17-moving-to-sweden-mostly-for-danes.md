teaser: I’ll be moving to Sweden in about a month, so I collected some links which I’d like to share here. I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your holiday!

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list (see my story "Links: Swedish language") or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

This is mostly of interests for Danes - sorry I'm so subjective here...

*   [ØresundDirekt](http://www.oresunddirekt.com/)  
    Mostly for Danes and Swedes from the border region (Copenhagen/Skåne). Information about the differences between the countries, living in one country and working in the other etc. Page in Swedish and Danish.

*   [Flyt til Sverige](http://flyttilsverige.nu/frontpage/)  
    Again a page mostly for Danes, pursuading them to move to Sweden. (Who wouldn't want to anyway?!) Page in Danish only.

*   [Øresund Region](http://www.oresundsregionen.org/index.php?)  
    About the border region between Sweden and Denmark. Page in English, Swedish and others.

*   [Hallo Norden](http://www.hallonorden.org/ssp/hn/module/presentation/?XModuleId=13883&LanguageId=13115)  
    Information for those moving between the Nordic countries. Page in English, Swedish and others.

*   [Scanianet](http://www.scanianet.dk/)  
    Information for people moving from Denmark to Sweden. Page in Danish only.
