teaser: I’ll be moving to Sweden in about a month, so I collected some links which I’d like to share here. I hope there is something of interest to you, whether you are thinking of moving to Sweden or just need some help for your holiday!

Whenever possible I try to link to the English version of the pages, but some of them are in Swedish only. Just try to use the dictionaries from my list or ask in the forums or me if you have trouble understanding something :-)

**Language**  
The Swedish language is not as hard as it might look at first glance! For me it bears a lot of resemblance to Danish and to a lesser extent also to German. The best part though is that you'll hardly find another country where you can expect almost anybody to understand and speak fluent English than Sweden.

*   [Swedish-English dictionary and vice-versa](http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/swe-eng.html). This page is in English.
*   [Swedish-German dictionary and vice-versa](http://deutsch-schwedisches-woerterbuch.elch.nu/lexikon.php). Page in German and Swedish.

*   [First international collection of tongue twisters](http://www.uebersetzung.at/twister/sv.htm)  
    Here you'll find Swedish tongue twisters and their translations. If you can pronounce these without problems you're either a native or the most well-integrated person I know! But don't worry, most Swedish conversations are a lot easier :-) Page in Swedish and English.
